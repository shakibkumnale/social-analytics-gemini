# **Social Media Performance Analysis**

### **Overview**  
This project is an analytics module that evaluates the performance of social media posts by calculating engagement rates and generating actionable insights.

### **Key Features**  
- Calculates engagement rates using the formula:  
  \[
  \text{Engagement Rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Likes} + \text{Comments} + \text{Shares}}{\text{Reach}}\right) \times 100
  \]
- Provides insights comparing different post types (Reels, Carousel, Static).
- Utilizes **Gemini AI API (Google Generative AI)** for advanced generative insights.

### **Tech Stack**  
- **Database**: DataStax Astra DB for storing and querying engagement data.  
- **API**: Gemini AI API for generating insights.  
- **Workflow**: Langflow for streamlined integration and analytics.  

### **Why Gemini AI API?**  
Due to unavailability of an OpenAI API key, the Gemini AI API was used as an alternative, offering similar functionality for the assignment's requirements.  

### **How It Works**  
1. Fetches engagement data from Astra DB.  
2. Calculates engagement metrics and rates for each post type.  
3. Uses Gemini AI API to generate actionable insights.
